The trapezoidal rule gives the area under a curve by adding the lengths of the trapezoids formed by connecting the points of the curve with the midpoints of the adjacent line segments. The trapezoids are formed by connecting the points of the curve with the midpoints of the adjacent line segments. The trapezoids are then added together to get the area under the curve. The trapezoidal rule is given by:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} (t_2 - t_1)^2 dt$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the area under the curve, $t_1$ is the time of the injection, $t_2$ is the time of the measurement, and $dt$ is the time interval between the two points.\n\nIn this case, the area under the curve"
