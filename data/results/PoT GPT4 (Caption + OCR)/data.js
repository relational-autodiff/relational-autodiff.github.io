Dy- nalang outperforms language- conditioned IMPALA and R2D2, as well as the task-specific EMMA architecture, fitting the most complex stage of the game where other methods fail to achieve non-trivial performance.' Overall, the image shows that Dynalang is a more effective language model for the Messenger game than IMPALA, R2D2, and EMMA.
