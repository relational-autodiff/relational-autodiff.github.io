Since we have already found the midpoint of the leg connecting points T and S, which is point B, we can determine the value of $m \\angle S$ by finding the angle bisector between $A$ and $B$ (midpoint of legs RS and TS).\n\nSince both points A and B lie on the same side of the angle bisector of $\\angle S$, they are called corresponding angles, and the angle bisector between them is called the common angle bisector of $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe common angle bisector of $A$ and B is a line that bisects the angle between A and B, which is $\\angle A_2B_3$. Since $\\angle A_2B_3 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, the common angle bisector of $A$ and B is the line that passes through point B and bisects the angle between points $A$ and $(A+B) \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nIn other words, the common angle bisector of $A$ and B is the line that passes through point B and bisects the angle $A_3B_2$. Since $A_3$ and $B_2$ are both on the same side of the line through B, the common angle bisector of $A$ and B lies on the line connecting points $A_3$ and $B_2$.\n\nNow, we can determine the value of $m \\angle S$ by finding the point on the common angle bisector that is equidistant from points A and B. This point is the midpoint of the line connecting points $A_3$ and $B_2$, which is point M.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $m \\angle S = \\angle M_2B_3$ is the angle bisector of $A_3$ and B.\n\nSince the angle bisector of $A_3$ and B is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians, we can substitute $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for $m \\angle S$ to get the correct option: B"
